# infosec_scripts_master
A more detailed and useful commit from previous generic linux shell scripts for basic administration, however these are intended to be more geared towards streamlining the infosec gathering and reporting process of commonly used third party github packages dedicated towards an ongoing project of mine to make an often week long process of gathering installing and configuring a painless five minute process in a packaged framework for easy management once installed. Intended use cases for threat hunting in bug bounty programs.
